"""What the spins are, and what each kind of event does to them.

A signal model made of a state machine splits in two. A
:class:`SpinPhysics` says what a voxel holds -- which tissue properties
are exposed, and so which physics the kernels carry -- and what each kind of
event is realized as: whether an excitation is ideal or integrated from a
waveform, whether a readout is followed by an unbalanced gradient, by ideal
spoiling, or by nothing. A :class:`Simulator` says what order the
events are played in.

Splitting them is what lets one be changed without the other. The MRF timing
with a selective excitation, or a refocused train whose readout spoils rather
than winds, is an assignment rather than a new model.

**The operators are resolved before a description exists.** A simulator binds
each slot when it is constructed; what a protocol then produces is an ordinary
:class:`~torchsim.sequence.SequenceDescription`, whose events carry their own
action word. From there the path is the fused one -- packing, the feature
mask, the real-subspace verdict, offload and sharding -- and nothing consults
an operator slot again. There is no interpretation at run time and none per
event.

Three vocabularies name a pulse along that path, and they are not the same
vocabulary at three sizes. :class:`EventOperators` has one slot per role a
sequence is written in terms of, and its values are operator factories, read
only while a description is being assembled. Each factory emits events tagged
with an :class:`~torchsim.sequence.RfUse`, which is what a Pulseq file
carries, and with an :class:`~torchsim.sequence.EventAction`, which is the bit
field the kernels read. The three do not line up one to one and are not meant
to: the :attr:`~EventOperators.saturation` slot plays a pulse tagged
``RfUse.EXCITATION``, because what the scanner is told about a pulse and what
role the sequence gives it are separate questions.

        This is the path a description arriving from a scanner takes:
        ``FSESimulator.from_description(stream)`` says the events are to be
        read as a refocused train, and the only thing left to give is the
        tissue. Echo spacing, echo train length, flip angles and pulse shapes
        are in the stream and are not named again.

        Which simulator you call it on is the whole of what you choose, and it
        matters. A description says what was played -- an RF pulse, tagged with
        the use its designer gave it, and an ADC window -- and says nothing
        about the gradients between them, because the transport carries none.
        The dephasing lives in the handlers instead: a
        :func:`~torchsim.SSFPFidReadout` winds one order after every sample, a
        :func:`~torchsim.SSFPEchoReadout` winds it before, a
        :func:`~torchsim.SPGRReadout` spoils, and a refocusing pulse is
        crushed either side. So the events are re-emitted through this model's
        own operators rather than taken as they arrive.

        Parameters
        ----------
        description : SequenceDescription
            The stream, as the MRD client decodes it or a Pulseq design
            exports it.
        model : SpinPhysics, optional
            The physics to read it with. Defaults to this simulator's own,
            which is what naming a concrete one is for.
        settings : Any, optional
            Run settings and tissue, as the constructor takes them.

        ------
        ValueError
