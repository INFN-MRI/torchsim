# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Removed

- **`torchsim.epg`.** The package held the state-machine operators the
  simulator's torch loop was written from. That loop is gone: every sequence
  now runs on the fused CPU and CUDA kernels, which reach the same operators
  through their own code. The operators survive as the tests' parity oracle
  and are no longer part of the public API.

  There is no replacement to import. Code that called them to run a sequence
  should describe the sequence and simulate it -- `fse_description(...)` and
  friends, then `FSE().simulate(...)` -- which is what the package was being
  used to assemble by hand.

- **`EpgSimulator.before_rf`, `after_rf`, `before_adc` and `after_adc`.** What
  a policy played around an event is carried by the event itself, as an
  `EventAction`, so a description says what it plays and both the builders and
  a Pulseq import can set it.

- **The `backend` argument to `simulate`.** There is one implementation, so
  there is nothing to select between. A tissue no kernel can take now raises.

- **`slice_profile=` as a tensor of flip-angle scalings**, and
  `torchsim.utils.slice_prof` with it. A slice profile is a Bloch response and
  is worked out from the RF definition; `slice_profile=` now says only where
  across the slice to sample it, through `exact_slice_profile(...)`.

- **`slice_prof` on `FSEModel`, `MRFModel`, `MPnRAGEModel`** and their
  functional wrappers, for the same reason. Give the RF definition its
  waveform instead.
